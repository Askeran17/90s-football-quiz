# The 90´s Football Quiz

The quiz is dedicated to football fans of the 90s. In the last era of the century there were many glorious events, many football stars, there was a different football atmosphere than today, and therefore I would like football fans to refresh their memory and go back a little to the past and feel the emotions that filled them when they watched football in the 90s. This quiz will help them plunge into that atmosphere.

- The following is a biography of St. Joseph and his disciples. Photos of students are beautifully circled and placed on the left side of the text. For the circle I used border-radius property and others which you can see more in the style.css.

__Footer__

- In the footer I have placed a link to YouTube, where the visitor can watch a film about St. Joseph. I did not insert a link to the video inside the main content, but decided to place it in the footer, since it is convenient, does not take up much space and just looks beautiful with the YouTube button. The link opens in a separate tab and the visitor is taken to YouTube, while the site remains open. It is very comfortable. And under YouTube button I placed copyright.

__Last page__

- On the last page I posted information for pilgrims to the holy Mount Athos, which office they can contact before going there. He also indicated the address of the bureau itself and its opening hours.

## Testing

Throughout the development of the site, I used Google's developer tools to identify and fix any problems along the way.

If something didn't work correctly, I also used Google's developer tools to tweak and fix the problem.

I've thoroughly tested each page using Google Chrome's developer tools to ensure each page is responsive on a variety of screen sizes and devices.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Desktop Results

### Validator Testing 

- HTML

  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Faskeran17.github.io%2Fst-josephs-brotherhood%2F&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1)

### Unfixed Bugs

I wanted to add an interactive function for entering a name in the start display so that when the final result occurs, the person’s name is saved in a separate list of points scored and the result is recorded under his name. But I still haven’t figured out how to do it, so I don’t have this function.
