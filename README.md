# The 90´s Football Quiz

The quiz is dedicated to football fans of the 90s. In the last era of the century there were many glorious events, many football stars, there was a different football atmosphere than today, and therefore I would like football fans to refresh their memory and go back a little to the past and feel the emotions that filled them when they watched football in the 90s. This quiz will help them plunge into that atmosphere.

## Features

### Existing Features

__Start screen__

- At the start screen you see a football field with a ball, as well as a greeting - this all indicates that we will be talking about football. There is also a start button at the start, which will introduce the user to the quiz.

__Game Quiz__

- After the user presses the start button, he is taken to a screen that shows the quiz. There are 10 questions waiting for him, each of which offers 4 possible answers. Here the user also has the opportunity to track how many correct answers he guessed and how many incorrect ones. If the option is correct, then it goes into the green column; if it is incorrect, it goes into the red column. The score is also displayed at the top of the quiz itself. If the user guesses the correct answer, he gets 5 points; if not, he receives a message that next time he will be able to guess.

## Testing

Throughout the development of the site, I used Google's developer tools to identify and fix any problems along the way.

If something didn't work correctly, I also used Google's developer tools to tweak and fix the problem.

I've thoroughly tested each page using Google Chrome's developer tools to ensure each page is responsive on a variety of screen sizes and devices.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Desktop Results

### Unfixed Bugs

I wanted to add an interactive function for entering a name in the start display so that when the final result occurs, the person’s name is saved in a separate list of points scored and the result is recorded under his name. But I still haven’t figured out how to do it, so I don’t have this function.
